Dronefly cog repository
-----------------------

Dronefly bot is based on `Red Discord
Bot <https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot>`__ but it is also the
name of the Red cog repository for the bot on GitHub. The latter provides
the components that interact with sites of interest to its users, such as
iNaturalist.

While some developers and some users may have an interest in the repository,
most will find it simplest to just use the bot on Discord. You don't need to
download anything from this site to do that.

If you do want to run your own bot with the cogs from Dronefly repository on
it, see the Installation instructions below.
